          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>The killdeer <em>(Charadrius vociferus)</em> is a large plover found in the
            Americas. Its common name comes from its call. </p>
          <p> Killdeers are mostly brown with rufous fringes, their heads have patches of white and
            black, and two black bands cross the breast. The belly and the rest of
            the breast are white. They can be found in coastal wetlands, beach
            habitats, and coastal fields.</p>
          <p>It primarily feeds on insects along with
            some other invertebrates and seeds. It is a forager and prefers to
            look for food in areas with short vegetation and with cattle and
            standing water. It feeds during the day but in nonbreeding season it
            feeds at night during the full moon.</p>

          <p> An adult killdeer can range from 20 -28cm and have a wingspan between
            59 and 63cm. They usually weigh around 72 to 121g. It has a short,
            thick, and dark bill, flesh-colored legs, and a red eye ring. The
            killdeer has a maximum lifespan of at least 10 years and 11 months. </p>
          <p>Its upperparts are mostly brown with rufous fringes, its cap,
            back, and wings being the former color. It has a white forehead and a
            white stripe behind the eye, and its lores and the upper borders to
            the white forehead are black. The breast and belly are white and has
            two black breast bands. It is the only plover in North America with
            two breast bands. It has a red rump with a brown tail.</p>
          <p>The killdeer is
            a vocal species, calling even at night. Its calls include nasal notes,
            like "deee", "tyeeee", and "kil-deee" (the basis of its common name).
            During display flights, it repeats a call of "kil-deer" or
            "kee-deeyu". When this plover is disturbed, it emits notes in a rapid
            sequence, such as "kee-di-di-di". Its alarm call is a long, fast
            trill.</p>

          <p>The killdeer nests in open fields or other flat areas with short
            vegetation such as agricultural fields and meadows. Their nest consist
            of a shallow depression or scrape in the ground lined with some stones
            and grass. Killdeer lays four to six eggs at a time. The female
            produces eggs while the male defends his territory. The eggs are
            approximately 38 by 27mm in size and are beige with brown markings and
            black speckles.</p>
          <p>The eggs are typically laid from mid-March to early
            June in the southern portion of the range, and from mid-April to
            mid-July in the northern part. </p>
          <p>About 53% of eggs are lost, primarily
            due to predators. Those that survive are closely always guarded by at
            least one parent. The young are brooded during rain until about 15
            days after hatching and during night for about 18 days after hatching.
            The only time when they are not in the presence of a parent is when
            the parents are mating or responding to a predator.</p>
            <p>Their young fledge
              about 31 days after hatching, and generally move to moister areas in
              valleys and on the banks of rivers. They may be cared for by their
              parents for up to 10 days after they fledge, and exceptionally for 81
              days after hatching.</p>

          <p>Its diet consists of beetles, flies, millipedes, worms, snails,
            spiders and some seeds. They also indulge in tree frogs and dead
            minnows. They are foragers by behavior and can also forage during the
            night according to the lunar cycle.</p>
          <p>They use techniques like
            <em>"foot-trembling"</em>, where it stands on one foot, shaking the other in
            shallow water for about five seconds, pecking at any prey stirred up
            to forage for food. They often follow plows to eat the disturbed
            earthworms that come to the surface.</p>

          <p>The killdeer is parasitized by acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes,
            and trematodes. Their common predators are herring gulls, common
            crows, raccoons, and striped skunks.</p>
          <p> Killdeer use a variety of
            responses to distract predators during the breeding season. They used
            tactics like the <em>“broken – wing display”</em> to distract the predator from
            the nest.</p>
          <p>Another method is the <em>"ungulate display"</em>, where the adult
            raises its wings, exposes its rump, lowers its head, and charges at
            the intruder. This can be fatal to the displaying bird.</p>

          <p> The killdeer
            is considered a least-concern species by the IUCN due to its large
            range of about 26.3 million km2 (10.2 million sq mi) and population,
            estimated by the IUCN to be about one million birds, or about two
            million, according to the <cite>Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>Though the population is declining, it is not decreasing fast enough
              to be considered a vulnerable species. It is protected in the US by
              the <cite>Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</cite>, and in Canada by the <em>Migratory
                Birds Convention</em></p>
