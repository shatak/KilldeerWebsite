              <p>My name is Akshat Jain. I am currently a student at Seneca College. This website was made as a part of my assignment for the course WEB222. I am a designer and have tried to make the site as pretty as possible at my current knowledge level. I hope to gain more knowledge in this field and become a web developer someday.</p>
